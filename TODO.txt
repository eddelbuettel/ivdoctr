# TODO File
2. Do we still need the quadratic and cubic solvers from helper_functions?
Requires a double check that as implemented, bounds are not too sensitive.
3. Simplify SamplingUncertainty
    - draw_sigma_CLT and draw_sigma_jeffreys can be combined with a
      Jeffreys = T/F toggle
4. Simplify SummarizeAndPlot
5. Regenerate continuous tables from paper
6. Check exogenous variables for Weber table becaues IV numbers are not the same
7. Is there a reason we stop CLT sampling if we draw a non-PSD matrix? Can't we
just throw out the bad ones?
8. Is p_valid being computed properly? Probably requires building a few tests...
