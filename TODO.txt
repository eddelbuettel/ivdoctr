# TODO File
1. Double check and write tests for IdentifiedSet lines 156-end (checking the beta bounds)
2. Do we still need the quadratic and cubic solvers from helper_functions? 
Requires a double check that as implemented, bounds are not too sensitive.
3. Simplify SamplingUncertainty
    - draw_sigma_CLT and draw_sigma_jeffreys can be combined with a 
      Jeffreys = T/F toggle
4. Simplify SummarizeAndPlot
5. Regenerate continuous tables from paper
6. Check exogenous variables for Weber table becaues IV numbers are not the same
7. Make get_r_uz_bounds vectorized
    - Done.
8. Fix toList() function in draw_sigma_CLT 
    - This was caused by generateTable file
