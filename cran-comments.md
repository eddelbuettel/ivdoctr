## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed par(mfrow=c(1,1)) from 3d_plot.R so user options are not changed
* Added examples for exported functions (ivdoctr, makeTable, and plot_3d_beta)
* Added vignette applying package to empirical exercise
* Created ivdoctr function to generate a list of objects instead of only printing results to the console

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 20.04, R 4.0.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

One NOTE:
New submission

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
