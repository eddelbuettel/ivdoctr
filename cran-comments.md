## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed \dontrun{} from examples of exported functions, except for maketTable() which writes a file. That example does not run to ensure nothing is written on the user's computer without their knowledge.
* Updated url to file issues
* Updated README file

## Test environments
* local ubuntu 20.04, R 4.0.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

One NOTE:
New submission

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
